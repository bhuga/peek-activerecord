# Peek::Activerecord

This plugin displays the ActiveRecord queries run during a request.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'peek-activerecord'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install peek-activerecord

In `/app/assets/stlyesheets/application.scss`:

```
 = require peek/views/activerecord
 = require peek/views/activerecord/pygments
```

In `/app/assets/javascripts/application.coffee`:

```
#= require peek/views/activerecord
```

This works the same way in `application.js` if you have that instead, just put
the require in a comment.

## Usage

Any page with `peek_enabled?` will have a new `ActiveRecord Queries` link. Click
on it to see your queries:

Controllers have a new method, `peek_activerecord_enabled?`, that you can
overwrite to separate AR enabled-ness from peek enabled-ness if you like.
