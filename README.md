# Peek::Activerecord

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/peek/activerecord`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

TODO: Delete this and the text above, and describe your gem

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'peek-activerecord'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install peek-activerecord

In `/app/assets/stlyesheets/application.scss`:

```
 = require peek/views/activerecord
 = require peek/views/activerecord/pygments
```

In `/app/assets/javascripts/application.coffee`:

```
#= require peek/views/activerecord
```

This works the same way in `application.js` if you have that instead, just put
the require in a comment.

## Usage

Any page with `peek_enbled?` will have a new `ActiveRecord Queries` link. Click
on it to see your queries:

Controllers have a new method, `peek_activerecord_enabled?`, that you can
overwrite to separate AR enabled-ness from peek enabled-ness if you like.
